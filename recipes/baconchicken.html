                Amp up the flavor of your chicken with bacon! These are butterflied: either do it yourself or ask your

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <ul>
                <li>3 boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste</li>
                <li>3 slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>6 spears fresh asparagus</li>
                <li>9 slices bacon</li>
                <li>12 each wooden toothpicks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Steps</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) if recommended by manufacturer.</li>
                <li>Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, slice horizontally through the
                    middle,
                    beginning at the thickest part, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open
                    the
                    2 sides and spread them out like an open book.</li>
                <li>Season both sides with lemon-pepper season. Place 1 slice of cheese on each chicken breast. Cut
                    asparagus spears in half and place 4 halfs on top of the cheese. Roll the chicken up and over the
                    cheese
                    and aspargus, keeping the stuffing inside each roll. Wrap each chicken breast with 3 pieces of
                    bacon,
                    using wooden toothpicks to secure the bacon, where it overlaps.</li>
                <li>Place each bacon-wrapped breast in the air fryer basket and air fry for 15 minutes. Turn and cook
                    for 15
                    minutes more. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
                    reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>

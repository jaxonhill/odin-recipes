        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs,
                skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
            <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture
                evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs,
                skin-side up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs and brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An
                instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
        </ol>

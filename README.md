# odin-recipes
Odin Project's recipe project
The current project is to make a recipe website with three pages that are recipes. The recipe pages have an image, a paragraph description, an unordered list of the ingredients, an ordered list of the steps, and a "Back to Home" relative link.

Through this project I learned how to make constant commits to Git and then push those commits to Github. I also learned how to create different relative links to separate pages. In addition to this, I also learned: HTML boilerplates and basic HTML tags (title, p, img, a, ul, ol, li, em, strong, etc). This is still at the beginning stages of learning Linux/Ubuntu OS as well, so I was getting comfortable with cd, mkdir, touch, etc. I also utilized the terminal to utilize Git and Github (git add, git commit -m, git commit, git push).
